2025-07-27T07:09:08.587Z	(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
2025-07-27T07:09:08.587Z	- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
2025-07-27T07:09:08.587Z	- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
2025-07-27T07:09:08.587Z	- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
