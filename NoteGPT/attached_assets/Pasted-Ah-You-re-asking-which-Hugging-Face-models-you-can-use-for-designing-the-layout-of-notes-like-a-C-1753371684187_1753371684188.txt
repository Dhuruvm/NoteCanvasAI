Ah! You’re asking which Hugging Face models you can use for designing the layout of notes — like a Canvas AI that knows how to arrange things visually (not just write text). Here's a precise and powerful guide 👇


---

🧠✨ Hugging Face Models for Design/Layout Understanding or Generation

These models help in understanding or generating structured, visually appealing layouts – especially for documents like PDFs, slides, and forms.


---

🔲 1. LayoutLMv3

> 📚 Microsoft’s LayoutLMv3
🔗 huggingface.co/microsoft/layoutlmv3-base



Task: Visual document understanding (form, PDF, Canvas layout)
What It Does: It understands the structure and layout of documents — where elements like headings, bullets, boxes, and images go.
✅ Best for: Parsing layout, mimicking styles from existing templates.


---

🧾 2. Donut (Document Understanding Transformer)

> 🤖 From NAVER AI
🔗 huggingface.co/naver-clova-ix/donut-base



Task: OCR-free document understanding
What It Does: Takes screenshots/images of designed layouts (like Canva or PDF) → gives structured text with design hierarchy.
✅ Best for: Learning and replicating how notes are styled from visual examples.


---

🧠 3. Pix2Struct

> 📸 Google’s Pix2Struct for layout parsing
🔗 huggingface.co/google/pix2struct-docvqa-base



Task: Vision-to-structured-text
What It Does: Reads a visual layout (image/screenshot of document or canvas) and converts it into structured text or HTML format.
✅ Best for: Training your own canvas-designing system by showing image → get layout back.


---

💡 4. TAPAS (Table Parsing)

> 🔗 huggingface.co/google/tapas-large-finetuned-wtq



Task: Table understanding and creation
What It Does: Can read data and generate beautifully structured tables – great for the stats, comparison parts of notes.
✅ Best for: Creating stylish tables in your notes.

🚀 BONUS: Use These with Prompt Engineering

You can combine LLMs + layout models to generate structured HTML with embedded design like:

<h1>📘 The Solar System</h1>
<p style="color: #555">An introduction to planets and their motion.</p>
<div style="border-left: 4px solid #00aaff; padding: 10px;">
🪐 Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun.
</div>
